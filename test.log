[Tue Apr  2 14:48:19 2013] <Test> Estimate a safe maximum line length for the given command. This is done by assuming the maximum values for nickname length,  realname and hostname combined with the command that needs to be sent and  some guessing. A theoretical maximum value is used because it is possible  that our nickname, username or hostname changes (on the server side) while  the length is still being calculated.
[Tue Apr  2 14:48:31 2013] <Test> The maximum number of octets to send at a time.  This has the effect of  turning a single call to msg() into multiple commands to the  server.  This is useful when long messages may be sent that would otherwise cause the server to kick us off or silently truncate the text we are  sending.  If None is passed, the entire message is always send in one  command.

[Tue Apr  2 15:04:01 2013] <Test>  You'll probably want to find out what on earth an esoteric programming language is in the first place. Then, you might want to explore the complete list of languages, or find something more specific with the categories. You could also visit the joke language list, which lists languages that can't even be programmed in. Failing that, you could take a look at a completely random page.  
[Tue Apr  2 15:04:06 2013] <Test>  If you've just created a language, you can create an article for it  by typing its name into the search box, but be sure to take a look at  the help guide first. Then you should add it to the language list (or the joke language list, as appropriate). If you haven't got that far yet, take a look at the list of ideas for inspiration. Otherwise, you could help out with a work in progress.
