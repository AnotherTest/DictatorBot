[Sat Mar 30 16:37:29 2013] <james> 16 years is forever.
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:24 2013] <sam> i have a question
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:22 2013] <james> Typo woops
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:17 2013] <james> 16*
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:09 2013] <sam> got the name wrong
[Sat Mar 30 16:36:59 2013] <arthur> Hi aineeyyy
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:05 2013] <arthur> Aimeeyyy
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:13 2013] <Aimeeyyy> Hiya!
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:19 2013] <arthur> Hey
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:22 2013] <sam> also
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:25 2013] <james> But still.
[Sat Mar 30 16:37:37 2013] <arthur> For who sam
[Sat Mar 30 16:38:09 2013] <sam> arthur, james: Do I get a server which I could keep running for ~2 years or so but not great specs? Do I hoarde the money?  Or do I buy a powerful server? Or do I buy a server from an ISP with a good ToS and run a Tor exit or something?
[Sat Mar 30 16:38:34 2013] <james> It depends on what the specs are.
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:28 2013] <reece> Doctor Who can no longer be a kids show, after making last seasons cast jump off a fucking tower block to their deaths
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:28 2013] <reece> james I am not looking forward to doctor who
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:22 2013] <james> Yeah, that's true.
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:18 2013] <james> I doubt you'd need that much space for that anyway.
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:04 2013] <sam> Y'know, nothing big at all.
[Sat Mar 30 16:38:55 2013] <arthur> The latter sounds good
[Sat Mar 30 16:38:57 2013] <sam> Let's assume they're comfortable enough for IRC/znc/maybe nginx but around 10-15GB HDD
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:15 2013] <sam> the Tor exit with the good ISP would be expensive though
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:20 2013] <sam> and still risky..
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:26 2013] <arthur> No need for a powerful server then
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:28 2013] <reece> it seems like its gunna be shit
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:36 2013] <sam> BUT I would have a few hops away from me even if I ran the exit
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:40 2013] <Aimeeyyy> How are you all?
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:26 2013] <arthur> Gmm
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:24 2013] <Test> sam: just make some money?
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:21 2013] <james> Reece die.
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:17 2013] <reece> GAAAY
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:16 2013] <arthur> The last one sounds good sam
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:14 2013] <sam> selfishly: I want to get a tiny server and keep it for a while - but i don't know what i'd even do with it
[Sat Mar 30 16:39:58 2013] <sam> ethically: I wish to run the Tor exit
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:12 2013] <reece> well this is gay
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:16 2013] <reece> tonights DW is 45 mins

[Sat Mar 30 16:40:18 2013] <james> WHY NOT REECE
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:21 2013] <james> Die.
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:24 2013] <reece> what?
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:31 2013] <sam> test: not my money so
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:49 2013] <james> Great, you?
[Sat Mar 30 16:41:44 2013] <sam> arthur: I'll probably run Tor on any, but only an exit on the latter. For the record, the latter would be expensive just as powerful would be. Powerful would just be expensive and good for something I don't know as I don't run lots of gaming shit or whatever.
[Sat Mar 30 16:41:06 2013] <sam> yeah i know that's what i'm referring to
[Sat Mar 30 16:41:04 2013] <Josh> he was gonna buy ircx a server for a year
[Sat Mar 30 16:40:58 2013] <Josh> bryan sheep fucker bane was asking for you
[Sat Mar 30 16:41:05 2013] <Aimeeyyy> I am doing just great, thankyou! : )
[Sat Mar 30 16:41:09 2013] <arthur> Are you *only* going to run tor if you get the last one?

[Sat Mar 30 16:43:54 2013] <Test> ben: it's just a warning now, don't worry
[Sat Mar 30 16:44:02 2013] <sam> arthur: But what would I run on the first? It's worth noting that unless I hoarde the money into my account first, I shouldn't trust the server much but then the server is associated with me..
[Sat Mar 30 16:44:08 2013] <ben> can i like block it
[Sat Mar 30 16:44:12 2013] <sam> arthur: so I have a hell of a fucking dilemma
[Sat Mar 30 16:44:23 2013] <sam> james: yessssssss
